# Conference paper templates

Visit the branches in this repo, where each commit captures the contents of the
LaTeX paper template and associated sample PDF from a particular conference's
submission instructions.  This enables using git to compare paper templates and
see how they have changed from one conference to another.

Pull requests are welcome.
