\begin{abstract}
This document contains instructions and formatting guidelines
for authors submitting the camera-ready version of their papers
accepted to ISCA 2015.
\end{abstract}


\section{Instructions}
\subsection{Page Limits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All submissions should contain a maximum of 13 pages, including two-column body text, figures, tables, and references.
    \item Up to 11 body pages are free.  Pages containing ANY non-reference material will be counted as a body page. Pages containing only references are always free.
    \item Up to 2 additional body pages can be purchased for 100 USD per page, to be submitted during registration.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Formatting}
When typesetting your paper, please follow the guidelines listed in
Table~\ref{table:formatting}.  Do NOT include page numbers in the final
manuscript.

Make sure to include the names of all
authors along with their affiliation and email ID. Please refer to
the sample author block in this document.

Ensure that the figures and tables are legible.  Please also ensure that you
refer to your figures in the main text. Many readers print the papers in
gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure that the
different colors are distinguishable in gray-scale.

Avoid bad page or column breaks in your main text---i.e., last line of a
paragraph at the top of a column or first line of a paragraph at the end of a
column. If you begin a new section or sub-section near the end of a column,
ensure that you have at least 2 lines of body text on the same column.
